# Wind Power Forecasting

## Overview
This project predicts the mean daily wind power generated by a windmill for the next 15 days using weather, turbine, and rotor features. Data spans from January 2018 to March 2020, with readings recorded at 10-minute intervals. The target variable is `ActivePower`.

## Goal
Develop forecasting models to predict windmill power output and evaluate their performance using RMSE.

## Models Used
- **ARIMA**: Captures temporal dependencies in power output.
- **ETS**: Accounts for error, trend, and seasonality components.
- **Prophet**: Flexible and robust forecasting for time series with irregular trends.
